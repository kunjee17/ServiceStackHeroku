# ServiceStack with FSharp on Heroku#


Here is simple example of Running Serivcestack with FSharp. Application hosted on heroku.

Reference for [Servicestack](http://www.servicestack.net/) you can found out on given link. 

I mainly took two article as reference one is getting started with Servicestack with FSharp found [here](http://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/servicestack-new-api-f-sample-web-service-out-of-a-web-server/). It is by Sergey Tihon, on that site you can found many other article about functional programming and FSharp. A good way to start with FSharp and / or Functional Programming. 

Another article I took help is [here](http://blog.ashleytowns.id.au/posts/2013-04/2013-04-01-running-csharp-fsharp-xbuild-nuget-on-heroku.html). In this article it is explained for [NancyFx](http://nancyfx.org/). Another wonderful framework for web development. 

FSharp development is supported on [Appharbor](https://appharbor.com/) and also on Microsoft's windows Azure. But it is awesome to run on Linux / Heroku. 

I personally wanted this because I don't want to choose one service / platform over other just because my development language is not supported but because of service, price, support etc they are providing. So, now I guess there is nothing like language constraint anywhere as a Dot Net developer. And I hope this help others too for choosing their deployment platform.
